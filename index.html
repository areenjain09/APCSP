  <h2>Sophomore at Whitney High School</h2>
  
  <p>Hello! I'm Areen Jain, a sophomore at <a href="https://www.whitneyhs.us/" 
  target="_blank">Whitney High School</a>. 
  I'm passionate about technology and programming, and my goal is 
  to study computer science at UCLA. I have always been fascinated by 
  how technology shapes the world, and I dream of making an impact in 
  the field of software development. I am currently on the basketball 
  team and the school's ASB.</p>
